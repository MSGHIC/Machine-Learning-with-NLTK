Using materials in this repo, you will *evaluate* the performance of *Na√Øve Bayes*, *Decision Tree*, and *Random Forest* classifiers in handling *sentimental analysis* problem using *Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK)*.

Dataset used is for restaurant reviews of cuctomers.More details are available in a pdf report.

*Coded in python 3.6.4 , IDE: Anaconda3-5.1.0* 

*This work was done as course work for my AI class 2018*
